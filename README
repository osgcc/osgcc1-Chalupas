This is a game that I wrote during a 24 hour code blitz competition.  It got third.
My theme was chapulas.  It is your basic side scroller. I used only Windows API calls,
once again, instead of employing DirectX or OpenGL. It is, um, a little fun to play i
guess. I never got to implementing AI, so you just jump through the levels avoiding
minor nuisances like water, lava, and spikes.
